   Explanation of the Rapid Trigger Logic

   Rapid Trigger has 3 different settings:
   - (bool) continuous rapid trigger
   - (number) up sensitivity
   - (number) down sensitivity

   Rapid Trigger also has these 3 states:
   - (bool) whether key is pressed down
   - (bool) whether the key is inside the rapid trigger zone
   - (number) the current peak of the travel distance

   General Rapid Trigger description:

   Rapid Trigger allows the key to be dynamically pressed or released, depending on the distance travelled instead of
   being at a fixed actuation point. This is done by always remembering the lowest/highest peak the value reached
   and using it for reference. For example, if I press the key down by 3.5mm with my up sensitivity set to 0.2mm, the
   firmware will remember the 3.5mm as the peak, allowing me to move freely within 3.5-3.3mm without any changes and
   only releasing the key if I release the key by more than 0.2mm starting from the peak, meaning 3.3mm. The same logic
   applies to pressing the key down. If I move the key further up to 2.0mm with a down sensitivity of 0.5mm, the firmware
   will remember the peak of 2.0mm and not do anything between 2.0-2.5mm, since if I press the key back in beyond 2.5mm
   it will start pressing it again. If I do not push it beyong 2.5mm and instead decide to go further up than 2.0mm,
   the peak will of course updates as expected. This is the main logic that applies inside the so-called Rapid Trigger zone.

   Rapid Trigger Zone:

   Rapid Trigger is only active inside the Rapid Trigger Zone. The Rapid Trigger Zone is the zone below the actuation point,
   down to all the way pressed in. If the key enters that zone, a keypress is also performed, just like you're used to the
   traditional mode of how keyboards work. As long as the key is inside that zone, the logic described above applies.
   If the key leaves that zone, the key is always being released and the Rapid Trigger logic no longer applies.
   This is where the feature continuous rapid trigger (CRT) comes into play. Continuous rapid trigger causes the firmware to
   apply the Rapid Trigger logic over almost the full actuation range, to be specific everything >0.1mm travel distance.
   The only condition is that the key already entered the Rapid Trigger zone once. If CRT is enabled, once the key has
   entered the Rapid Trigger zone the logic described in the first paragraph applies until the key is *fully released*, meaning
   pressed in <0.1mm.

   Workflow of the Rapid Trigger code:

   The Rapid Trigger implementation in this firmware consists of 4 steps.
   Step 1: Check whether the key left the Rapid Trigger zone (normal) or was fully released (CRT mode)
   Step 2: Check whether the key has entered the Rapid Trigger zone, updating the inRapidTriggerZone state and pressing the key
   Step 3: Apply the dynamic travel distance checks, the core of the Rapid Trigger feature
   Step 4: Depending on whether the key is pressed or not, remember the lowest/highest peak achieved
